What hospitals are models of high-quality care? That is, which hospitals have the most consistently high scores for a variety of procedures.

To answer this question, the approach I chose to take is to look at the “Timely and Effective Care - Hospital” and “Readmission - Hospital” csv files and only look at hospitals that have an significant amount of measures in the files, rank them on a per measure basis (taking into account if it is a “lower the better” or “higher the better” scoring system), and then adding up all the rank and to display the top 10 hospitals. 

I believe this approach is more statistically correct, since just taking the average or sum of the score doesn’t reflect the quality care of the hospital. 

Here, I will outline the approach I took:

First, I use the percentile function to find the median number of procedures each hospitals have. From readmission csv, the median number of procedures is 11, therefore I am only taking hospitals with 10 or more procedures. Similarly, I found that the median number of procedures is 13 in the effective care csv. By filtering out the hospitals that have less than the median, I effectively cut down half the entries. Now, we have a list of hospitals that I considered to have significant data.

Then, to deal with the problem where there is a “lower the better” or “higher the better” scoring system, I use the rank function to rank all of the (new list of) hospitals and their respective effective care measures I care about. I looked at 14 measures, and I created a table for each measure. For the measure that is “lower the better”, I order by ascending. For the measure that is “higher the better”, I order by descending. 

Finally, I join the 14 tables together to create my ultimate table, and create a new column that is the sum of all the rows. In my final query, I just need to select the top 10 hospitals from there and order the total rank score by ascending order.  

The select query I used to output the top 10 hospital is:

SELECT final_table.provider_id, final_table.Total, hospitals.hospital_name FROM final_table INNER JOIN hospitals ON final_table.provider_id=hospitals.provider_id ORDER BY Total ASC LIMIT 10;

170123	2355	WESLEY MEDICAL CENTER
060034	3291	SWEDISH MEDICAL CENTER
420085	3513	GRAND STRAND REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER
260006	3623	MOSAIC LIFE CARE AT ST JOSEPH
100246	4027	LAWNWOOD REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER & HEART INSTITUTE
260027	4345	RESEARCH MEDICAL CENTER
340014	4393	NOVANT HEALTH FORSYTH MEDICAL CENTER
490107	4480	RESTON HOSPITAL CENTER
190026	4716	RAPIDES REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER
520138	5018	AURORA ST LUKES MEDICAL CENTER

Therefore, the top ten hospitals that are models of high quality care, according to my definition outlined earlier, are: Wesley Medical Center, Swedish Medical Cdenter, Grand Strand Regional Medical Center, Mosaic Life Care At St Joseph, Lawnwood Regional Medical Center & Heart Institute, Research Medical Center, Novant Health Forsyth medical Center, Reston Hospital Center, Rapides Regional Medical Center, and Aurora St Lukes Medical Center.

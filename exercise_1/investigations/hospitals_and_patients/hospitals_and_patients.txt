Are average scores for hospital quality or procedural variability correlated with patient survey responses?

There are two parts of this question. First, to find out if average scores for hospital quality are correlated with patient survey responses, I create a rank_corr table that look at the survey response csv file and sum up the HCAHPS base and consistency score for each hospital. I join the result from the survey response csv with the final table I created in question 1 that has the hospital id along with the rank (of hospital of quality). Once we have this table, then I use the correlation function to find the Pearson coefficient of correlation between hospital quality ranking and patient survey response. My query gives me a correlation of -0.22, which means it is a small negative correlation. 

To answer the second part of the question, we want to find if procedural variability correlate with patient survey response. Since there are no survey response specific to a procedure, I need to define procedural variability per hospital. To do this, I created a procedural_var table that groups the procedure ranking by hospital and find the variance of procedure ranking per hospital. With this table, now we can do similar step as earlier and correlate the variance score for each hospital with its respecting survey score. My query gives me a correlation of -0.26, which is still a small negative correlation.
